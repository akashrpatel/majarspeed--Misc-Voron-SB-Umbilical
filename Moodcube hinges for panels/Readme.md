Modfied hinges made by Kaosmaker @ https://github.com/KayosMaker/MoodCube_Hinges to allow installation over paneles. Includes. 3mm, 4mm, 5mm and 5.7mm sizes. 


They are printed standing up vertical. And use a 5 mm pin as the hinge. 


They do need to be printed really heavy I ended up at 6 out side and 80% infill I believe.
