Created this to use in conjunction with an excellent umbilical mount created by [Minesekt](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Minsekt/Rear_Umbilical). This adds the same look as the one he created as an add on to the gantry. And incorparates it into the cable cover of the StealthBurner cable cover directly. 

Adds an addtional 4 Heatsets and 4 m3x10 screws to the SB build.
